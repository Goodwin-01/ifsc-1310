        <h2> Thoughts on Web on Accessibility </h2>
        <p> 
            Web accessibility means creating websites that can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities. It involves designing and developing web pages in a way that ensures that individuals with visual, hearing, motor, or cognitive impairments can easily navigate, understand, and interact with the content.

        <p>
            This can include using features like text descriptions for images, keyboard navigation, and readable fonts, making sure that the web is inclusive and usable by people of all abilities. In short, web accessibility is about breaking down barriers and ensuring equal access to information and services for all users.
        </p>
        <p>
            Web accessibility is required by law and helps people with disabilities participate more fully in society. It also improves the overall user experience and satisfaction. Accessible websites often use cleaner code, which means faster load times, fewer errors, and improved search engine positioning. This can lead to increased traffic and user engagement.
