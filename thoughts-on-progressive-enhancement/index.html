        <h2> Thoughts on Progressive Enhacements </h2>
        <p> 
            Progressive enhancement is a web development strategy that focuses on building a core, functional experience for all users, regardless of the device or browser they are using. At its heart, progressive enhancement prioritizes content and usability, ensuring that even users with older technology can access the core features of a website. Advanced functionality, such as enhanced visuals or interactivity, is added for users with modern browsers and devices.

            In simpler terms, it’s like designing a cake where the basic sponge is delicious on its own, but additional layers of frosting and decorations are included for those who can enjoy them. This approach ensures accessibility and inclusivity while allowing developers to take advantage of modern web capabilities.

            To me, progressive enhancement is about building a web experience that starts with a strong, accessible foundation and then grows more sophisticated for users with better technology. It's like designing something that works well for everyone first and then adding "nice-to-have" features for those who can enjoy them. I think this approach reflects a balance between creativity and responsibility in web development.
            I also see progressive enhancement as a philosophy that prioritizes users’ needs over flashy design. While advanced features can be exciting, they should complement the core content, not replace it. I believe modern web development is about finding that balance: creating engaging and innovative websites without compromising accessibility and performance.
