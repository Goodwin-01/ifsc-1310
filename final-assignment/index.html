                <h2>Dragon Vehicle Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Dragon is a free-flying spacecraft designed to deliver both cargo and people to orbiting destinations. Dragon made history in 2012 when it became the first commercial spacecraft in history to deliver cargo to the International Space Station and safely return cargo to Earth, a feat previously achieved only by governments. It is the only spacecraft currently flying that is capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth. Currently Dragon carries cargo to space, but it was designed from the beginning to carry humans. Under an agreement with NASA, SpaceX is now developing the refinements that will enable Dragon to fly crew. Dragon's first manned test flight is expected to take place as early as 2018.

                <p>
                    Photography is the art, science, and practice of capturing images through the use of light and a medium, whether digital or film. It involves a combination of technical and creative skills to create visual representations of subjects, moments, or scenes.

                <h2> Background of my journey </h2>

                    <p>
                        This all started out of boredem and wanting to start something new for myself. I always had an eye for photography and creating my own work from raw images. I spent my afternoon exploring downtown Chicago and admired how great it was, but I did not have a camera to capture any of my moments, other than my phone. I went to buy my first camera that exaact day, got on youtube and here we are 2 years later!
